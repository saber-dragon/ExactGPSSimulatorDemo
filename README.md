# Exact GPS Simulator Demo

This repo provides you a simple tool to help understand the GPS simulator proposed in [Exact GPS Simulation and Optimal Fair Scheduling with Logarithmic Complexity](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4396993/?reload=true). Please note that this is not an implementation of the proposed GPS simulator, but it can demonstrate you the steps of the algorithm for user-input small-scale test cases.
